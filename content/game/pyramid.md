# HOW TO PLAY SOLITAIRE100 PYRAMID SOLITAIRE:

## Objective

The objective of Pyramid Solitaire is to create pairs of exposed cards that total 13. The two cards that add up to 13 are discarded and the game is won when all 52 cards are discarded.

## Creating the pairs

Exposed cards in the pyramid are those which are not covered by any other card. Pairs of exposed cards that add up to 13 are clicked once and discarded in a pile on the top right of the game. The value of the face cards are as follows:
- Jack: 11
- Queen: 12
- King: 13 (Kings can be discarded as a single card rather than as a pair by double clicking on it or moving the card to the pile of discarded cards)

The deck on the top left of the game consists of a stock pile with a face up card at the top of the pile and is used to deal one additional card at a time. At any time, all exposed cards including the two exposed cards dealt from the stock pile as well as those in the pyramid can be used to create a pair that adds up to 13. The game is over if the stock pile has been exhausted and no other pairs can be created.
